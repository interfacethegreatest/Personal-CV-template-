    <p>Hello, my name is Drew Ellington. I'm an aspiring software developer looking to secure an entry level role. In terms of experience, I am currently undergoing a rigorous bootcamp, boosting my understanding of programming working within the subject by working approx. 5hrs a day from a selection pool of over 5,000 students. Prior to this, I graduated in 2022 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Forensic Investigation, looking then to retrain as a Software Developer.</p>
    <p>I wrote my dissertation in both Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Computer Forensics, which would work to fuel my interest in one day producing products. I'm motivated to make the world better, as well as mastering the fields of Machine learning and software engineering in order to produce products and bring people together.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Matlab / Machine Learning / Computer Vision</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My Education: In terms of my Education, I graduated in the summer of 2022 with a bachelors of science in Computer Forensic investigation.</p>
